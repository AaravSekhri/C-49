                <h3>Pigeon Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.</p>
                <p>They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</p>
                <p>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</p>
                <p>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>

                <h3>Chameleon Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</p>
                <p>Cameleons can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!</p>
                <p>Chameleons actual eyesight is great they can see small insects 5-10 meters away. They can also see in both visible and ultraviolet light.</p>

                <h3>Panda Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>The average lifespan of a wild giant panda is 15-20 years. Captive giant pandas can live up to 30 years. The record age for a captive giant panda is 38 years.</p>
                <p>The eyespots of a giant panda cub are initially in the shape of a circle. As the cub grows, the circles become shaped like a teardrop.</p>
                <p>Giant pandas are on the brink of extinction, with just over 1,000 pandas left in the world. They are so close to extinction, one reason is because of hunters who sell their fur.</p>
                <p>A panda fur is worth between $60,000 and $100,000 on the illegal trade market</p>
